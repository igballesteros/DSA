Hi Hi!!!

This is a repository where I re-learn data structures in C++.

Each file will contain either a refresher on concepts I knew before or new concepts I want to practice.

I will try to separate each concept or implementation into a new branch - as for now the branches are:
  master -> you will find a little refresher on pointers
  allo -> refresher in dynamically allocated memory
  linked_lists -> a program that implements linked lists
